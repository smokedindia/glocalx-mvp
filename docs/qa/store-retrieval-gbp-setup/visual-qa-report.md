## Findings

### ISSUE-001 - Bottom nav visual active state does not follow selected tab

Severity: Medium
Category: Visual / UX
Evidence:
- screenshots/desktop-08-app-insights.png
- screenshots/mobile-04-app-insights.png

What happened:
The app content switches to `GBP 성과 자세히` after selecting `성과`, but the visible active pill remains on `포스팅`. A DOM check confirmed `성과` has `aria-current="page"`, so the app state and accessibility state are correct while the visual highlight is stale.

User impact:
Users can land on the right screen but the nav tells them they are still on a different tab.

Repro:
1. Complete onboarding and enter `/app`.
2. Click `성과`.
3. Confirm the page heading changes to `GBP 성과 자세히`.
4. Observe the bottom nav still visually highlights `포스팅`.

### ISSUE-002 - Console shows resource errors during normal flow

Severity: Low
Category: Console
Evidence:
- local visual QA evidence JSON

Observed console entries:
- `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)` on the entry page.
- `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 409 (Conflict)` after attempting GBP publish.

What happened:
The 409 corresponds to the expected unverified-GBP publish block and the UI renders the correct Korean warning. The 404 did not reproduce as an app-level bad response in the captured network list, but it still appears in the browser console.

User impact:
No visible user-facing failure was observed, but the console is not clean.

Repro:
1. Open `/`.
2. Continue through onboarding to `/app`.
3. Generate a GBP draft.
4. Click `GBP 게시하기`.
5. Check console errors.

### ISSUE-003 - GBP pending handoff is visually long and easy to miss

Severity: Low
Category: UX
Evidence:
- screenshots/desktop-05-gbp-pending.png

What happened:
The onboarding chat retains the prior extraction, confirmation, setup, status, audit, follow-up, and dashboard CTA in one long vertical stream. The full page measured 1930px tall on a 1000px desktop viewport.

User impact:
The `대시보드로 이동` CTA can sit far below earlier context, so a user may need to scroll and scan more than expected after GBP setup completes.

Repro:
1. Complete Naver extraction.
2. Confirm the store profile.
3. Click `다음: GBP 세팅 확인`.
4. Observe the full pending handoff stream and the lower dashboard CTA.

## Passes

- No horizontal overflow found on any captured desktop or mobile screen.
- App tab content loads without the previous `Failed to fetch` card.
- GBP performance endpoint rendered metrics on desktop and mobile.
- Draft generation rendered a ready card with no layout break.
- Publish-blocked state rendered a Korean warning and did not falsely show success.
- Mobile 390x900 screenshots kept controls visible within the viewport.

## Console / Network Summary

Bad responses captured:
- 409 `POST /api/posts/.../publish`, expected for unverified GBP publish block.

Console errors captured:
- One generic 404 resource error on `/`.
- One 409 resource error after the expected publish block.
