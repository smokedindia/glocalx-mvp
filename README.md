# GlocalX MVP

GlocalX is a mobile-first owner assistant for Naver business extraction and Google Business Profile operations. This scaffold starts with a credential-free stub mode and leaves production integrations behind explicit adapter boundaries.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
npm run e2e
npm run format:check
```

## Local App

Run the app at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

```bash
npm run dev -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3000
```

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and keep real credentials out of git. Stub mode is the default until Naver Developers and Google Business Profile credentials are available.

## Integration Notes

### Naver Store Search

The app defaults to `APP_INTEGRATION_MODE=stub`. In stub mode, Naver search returns deterministic demo-style candidates for development and keeps explicit no-result fixtures for fallback testing.

Production Naver search requires:

```bash
APP_INTEGRATION_MODE=production
NAVER_CLIENT_ID=...
NAVER_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

Naver's official Local Search API reliably provides store name, category, address, road address, coordinates, and a detail link. It does not reliably provide phone numbers, and it does not provide opening hours. Treat phone and opening hours as best-effort fields: the app may attempt to read them from a submitted Naver Place link, but owners should still confirm or enter them manually.
